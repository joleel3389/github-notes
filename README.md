* Git
  * "Git" is the version control software (the application)
* Github
  * "Github" is different from a git because it is the web service that enables people to do "Git" on a website by signing up for it. 
* Repo
  * A "repo" is another word for "project", allowing multiple files to be within it (a repository of files)
* Commit
  * "Commit" works as a "save" button and confirms that you want to commit to your changes to the file. Commits have a "hash", which is a code made up of numbers and letters.
